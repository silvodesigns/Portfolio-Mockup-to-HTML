# Portfolio-Mockup-to-HTML
First project I created as a requirement to graduate from the Front End Developer program at Udacity

#Project Description
Developed a personal portfolio page using HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework. 
The page is fully responsive and works on mobile, tablet, and desktop browsers.

#How to Use
Open the index.html file with your favorite browser. Once in the landing page click on "View my work" in order to view portfolio pieces.
